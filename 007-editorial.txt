Part 7: Editorial Reorganization

This is part 7 in a series of proposals related to support for debugging
on heterogeneous architectures. This proposal is editorial in nature, and
does not make any substantive changes.

[Work in progress...]


BACKGROUND
----------

With the changes proposed in Part 6 of this series, DWARF expressions
and location descriptions have essentially been unified, and the
distinction between the two is no longer material. The bulk of this
proposal merely reorganizes the text from Sections 2.5 (DWARF
Expressions) and 2.6 (Location Descriptions) into a single section, and
rearranges the operators into more logical groupings.


PROPOSED CHANGES
----------------

In Section 2.5: DWARF Expressions (p. 26) and Section 2.6 Location
Descriptions:

Move DW_OP_nop to Control Flow Operations.

Rename Section 7.7 from "DWARF Expressions and Location Descriptions" to
"DWARF Expressions" (to reflect the unification of location descriptions
into DWARF expressions).

Rename Section 7.7.1 from "DWARF Expressions" to "Operation Expressions."

Delete Section 7.7.2, Location Descriptions.

Rename (and renumber) Section 7.7.3 from "Location Lists" to "Location
List Expressions."
